Title: TrustLink - Automated Service Level Agreement Enforcement on the Blockchain

Synopsis:

TrustLink is a decentralized application (dApp) designed to revolutionize the way service level agreements (SLAs) are monitored and enforced in the data center and fiber networking industry. Built on the Ethereum blockchain and leveraging Chainlink oracles, TrustLink offers a transparent, secure, and automated solution for managing SLA compliance.

The platform continuously monitors key performance indicators (KPIs) and other data points, ensuring adherence to agreed-upon service levels between parties. In the event of an SLA violation, TrustLink's smart contracts automatically transfer funds from an escrow account to the recipients. Both parties agree on the appropriate compensation or negotiate the amount to be released from the escrow account.

By utilizing blockchain technology and smart contracts, TrustLink eliminates the need for manual intervention, significantly reducing the time and effort required to manage SLAs. The platform's decentralized nature ensures data integrity and fosters trust between parties, while its user-friendly interface makes it accessible to both technical and non-technical users.

TrustLink's innovative approach to SLA enforcement has the potential to streamline processes, reduce disputes, and ultimately enhance customer satisfaction in the data center and fiber networking industry.

This workflow allows for a seamless interaction between the user, the Escrow.sol smart contract, and the KPI.sol smart contract while incorporating Chainlink for decentralized KPI monitoring.  Below are the steps:

	1. User connects to their MetaMask wallet.
	2. User clicks on getOrCreateEscrowAccount, which links the Escrow.sol contract to their MetaMask wallet.
	3. The user is presented with the methods and variables of the Escrow.sol smart contract.
	4. The user funds their escrow by interacting with the createEscrow function.
	5. The user clicks on getOrCreateKPIForEscrow, which links the KPI.sol contract to the corresponding escrowId.
	6. The user is presented with the methods and variables of the KPI.sol smart contract.
	7. The user enters the KPIs, and the KPI.sol contract creates a Chainlink for monitoring the KPIs on a schedule.
	8. If any Chainlink oracle returns a KPI violation, it notifies the KPI.sol contract.
	9. Upon receiving the KPI violation, the KPI.sol contract initiates the fulfillEscrow function of the Escrow.sol contract, which then proceeds with the escrow fulfillment process.
